# Protoflare

Protoflare helps you build AT Protocol apps on Cloudflare faster. It combines ATProto OAuth + XRPC, Lexicon validation, Jetstream firehose ingestion, edge caching (tags + revalidation), and session management into a single cohesive flow.

Highlights:

- Unified auth & XRPC client restoration per request.
- Durable Object Jetstream consumer with reconnect + cursor persistence.
- Tag-based edge caching & selective revalidation.
- Simple contexts: `getSession()`, `getAtprotoClient()`, `getRequest()`.
- One Vite plugin (`protoflare()`) sets up streaming + prerender environments.
- Included template (`templates/statusphere`) shows profiles, real-time feed, publishing.

Key exports: `protoflare/server`, `protoflare/client`, `protoflare/entry.browser`, `protoflare/entry.ssr`, `protoflare/vite`.
