TODO

- locate dead links for og styles

- think about moderation
  - "moderation" roles in our DB, not the network
  - posts public by default
  - users can hide posts
  - users can report posts
  - users can hide other users
  - moderators can delete posts
  - moderators can block users (stops ingestion, deletes submissions from DB, and stops login)
  - blocked users can still self host and access their data
  - moderators can filter posts by moderation reports
